# Fast and Robust Mesh Arrangements using Floating-point Arithmetic

This is a <b>header-only</b> version of the code we used for the experiments in the paper "**Fast and Robust Mesh Arrangements using Floating-point Arithmetic**" by G. Cherchi, M. Livesu, R. Scateni and M. Attene (ACM TOG, SIGGRAPH Asia 2020). 

|:warning: WARNING: We are rewriting portions of the code to be more efficient. This code is therefore subject to continuous updates, tests and fixes.  |
